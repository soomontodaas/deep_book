  abstract={A detailed data base of the Ardennes campaign of World War II (December 15, 1944 through January 16, 1945) has recently been developed. The present article formulates four Lanchester models of the campaign and estimates their parameters for these data. Two‐sided time histories of warfare on battles and campaigns are very rare, so Lanchester models have seldom been validated with historical data. The models are homogeneous in that tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, and manpower are weighted to yield a measure of strength of the Allied and German forces. This weighting is utilized for combat power and for losses. The models treat combat forces in the campaign (including infantry, armor, and artillery manpower) and total forces in the campaign (including both combat manpower and support manpower.) Four models are presented. Two models have five parameters (Allied individual effectiveness, German individual effectiveness, exponent of shooting force, exponent of target force, and a tactical parameter reflecting which side is defending and attacking.) The other two models remove the tactical parameter, which is not generally known prior to warfare, and estimate the other parameters without the tactical parameter. The main results of the research are (a) the Lanchester linear model fits the Ardennes campaign data in all four cases, and (b) when combat forces are considered Allied individual effectiveness is greater than German individual effectiveness, whereas when total forces are considered Allied and German individual effectiveness is the same. The interpretation of the latter result is that the two sides had essentially the same individual capabilities but were organized differently—the Allies chose to have more manpower in the support forces, which yielded greater individual capabilities in the combat forces. The overall superiority of the Allies in the campaign led to the attrition to the Allies being a smaller portion of their forces. © 1995 John Wiley \& },

  abstract={The validity of Lanchester's equations is demonstrated in an actual combat situation where U.S. forces captured the island of Iwo Jima. The equations tested are dM / dt = P ( t ) - AN , and dN / dt = - BM , with t the time elapsed since the beginning of the engagement, measured in days; M ( t ), and N ( t ) the number of effective friendly and enemy troops, respectively; A and B the friendly and enemy combat loss rates, respectively, per opposing combatant; and P ( t ) the rate friendly troops enter combat. Information required for the verification is the number of friendly troops put ashore each day and the number of friendly casualties for each day of the engagement, knowledge that enemy troops are not reinforced or withdrawn, the number of enemy troops at the beginning and end of the engagement, and the time T at the end of the engagement. If the number of enemy troops at the beginning of the engagement is not known, but the time, T , when the enemy is destroyed is known, it is still possible to determine whether Lanchester's equations are valid. In the analysis of the capture of Iwo Jima, the equations were found to be applicable. The value of such analyses increases when repeated often enough to permit general conclusions to be drawn.

  abstract={This article addresses the question of validating the homogeneous Lanchestrian square law of attrition by the use of historical data (and by extension, other attrition models). Validating an attrition model means testing that model against reality. In this case, Lanchester's square law is tested against the data from the Inchon‐Seoul campaign of the Korean War. The data are examined using three analysis techniques: linear regression, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bozdogan's Consistent AIC (CAIC). The data do not fit the assumption of a single, constant coefficient, homogeneous square law battle. The data do fit a set of three such battles (a new one every six or seven days); however, the data fit three constant‐casualty‐model battles just as well. The homogeneous Lanchester square law cannot be regarded as a proven attrition algorithm for warfare; however, the square law cannot be regarded as disproved either. Data on more battles are required to validate the square law or any other proposed attrition law. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract={Lanchester equations and their extensions are widely used to calculate attrition in models of warfare. This paper examines how Lanchester models fit detailed daily data on the battles of Kursk and Ardennes. The data on Kursk, often called the greatest tank battle in history, was only recently made available. A new approach is used to find the optimal parameter values and gain an understanding of how well various parameter combinations explain the battles. It turns out that a variety of Lanchester models fit the data about as well. This explains why previous studies on Ardennes, using different minimization techniques and data formulations, have found disparate optimal fits. We also find that none of the basic Lanchester laws (i.e., square, linear, and logarithmic) fit the data particularly well or consistently perform better than the others. This means that it does not matter which of these laws you use, for with the right coefficients you will get about the same result. Furthermore, no constant attrition coefficient Lanchester law fits very well. The failure to find a good‐fitting Lanchester model suggests that it may be beneficial to look for new ways to model highly aggregated attrition. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract={Most models of air and land combat use schemes of aggregation and disaggregation in representing combat systems, in spatial configuration, and in depicting progress of a battle. For example, the use of firepower “scores” is an extreme case of aggregation of weapons into a single measure. Combining like systems into weapons categories, partial aggregation, is a common approach to representing a large number of aircraft or ground weapons types. This article explores different approaches to aggregation and what is known theoretically about aggregation and disaggregation in combat models of the Lanchester type commonly called “square law” in two dimensions. It defines requirements for consistency between aggregate and higher‐dimensioned models of this type. Some important conclusions are that aggregation should take into account the specific capabilities of the opponent (raising concern about many “scored” approaches which attempt to evaluate force components in isolation), and that partial aggregation (grouping “like” systems) and disaggregation of previously aggregated results can only be done consistently when certain restrictions on the relative attrition capabilities of weapons systems hold. When this is the case, specific weightings for the force resources can be determined for the partial aggregations. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The structure of optimal fire distribution policies is discussed with reference to the influence of combatant objectives, termination conditions of the conflict, type of attrition process, and variable attrition‐rate coefficients. Implications for intelligence, command and control systems, and human decision making are pointed out.

In particular, given battle data, we assess the type of battle that occurred and whether or not it makes any difference to the number of casualties if an army is attacking or defending. Our approach is Bayesian and we use modern computational techniques to fit the model. We illustrate our method using data from the Ardennes campaign. We compare our results with previous analyses of these data by Bracken and Fricker. Our conclusions are somewhat different to those of Bracken. Where he suggests that a linear law is appropriate, we show that the logarithmic or linear‐logarithmic laws fit better. We note however that the basic Lanchester modeling assumptions do not hold for the Ardennes data. Using Fricker's modified data, we show that although his “super‐logarithmic” law fits best, the linear, linear‐logarithmic, and logarithmic laws cannot be ruled out. We suggest that Bayesian methods can be used to make inference for battles in progress. We point out a number of advantages: Prior information from experts or previous battles can be incorporated; predictions of future casualties are easily made; more complex models can be analysed using stochastic simulation techniques. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

abstract="The major feature of Quantified Judgment Method of Analyses (QJMA) is the Quantified Judgment Model (QJM), which is a metheniatical simulation of historical combat. The QJM systematically converts recorded statistical and descriptive data on ground combat engagements into quantified assessments of the force strength and combat potential of the opposing sides, thus permitting a ratio of their relative combat power. It does so by modifying the recorded strength of each in men and weapons by values representing the variables of combat, to the extent the record permits. These modifiers include such tangible variables as posture, weather, terrain, air superiority, mobility, logistical effectiveness, and vulnerability, and such intangibles (which can sometimes be assessed from the records) as leadership, morale, training, and experience. To permit comparison of the combat power ratio of the QJM with the outcomes of the historical engagements which produced the data, outcomes are represented quantitatively in terms of mission accomplishment, relative spatial effectiveness (ground gaining or holding), and relative casualty effectiveness.",

It discusses how robots can ultimately be more humane than humans in the battlefield. The author addresses the issue of autonomous robots having the potential to make life-or-death decisions and provides examples that illustrate autonomous systems ethical use of force. He also includes the opinions of the public, researchers, policymakers, and military personnel on the use of lethality by autonomous systems.}

 abstract = {The concept of morale has acquired a large variety of definitions, including a job satisfaction oriented definition that has recently gained prominence in the military. Using this definition, this paper attempts to answer two questions. First, what is the precise relationship between morale, as defined in terms of the soldier's satisfaction with his work environment, and proficiency and discipline? Second, how much impact does the soldier's unit have on his morale? After measuring and analyzing the morale, proficiency, and discipline of approximately four hundred soldiers in a number of combat arms units, this study concludes that morale is significantly related to proficiency and discipline, particularly for those soldiers with extremely high or low morale. However, morale does not appear to be significantly affected by the soldier's unit, but is rather determined by other factors, such as his long-term attitudes and values.},
