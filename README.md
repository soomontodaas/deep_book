**Can Autonomous Forces be trained with Artificially Intelligence (AI) algorithms like deep learning from historical data and further be improved by the rules set by Sun Tzu's Art of War for developing a state-of-the-art system of planning and analysis of Military Strategy?**
The application of Machine learning (ML) algorithms are general practice for extracting meaningful models from the data. ML could be unsupervised, supervised, or reinforcement learning. This book explores deep learning neural networks for extracting model parameters for generating autonomous forces, Although our main focus is on the world's largest tank battle that is Battle of Kursk, we are also exploring other iconic historical battle data of the world for validating the system. The battle of Kursk between the Soviets and Germans is known to be the biggest tank battle in the history. This book explores the two-dimensional-simplex tank and artillery data from the Kursk database for analyzing a class of discrete time homogeneous and heterogeneous Lanchester models. Under homogeneous form, the Soviet’s (or German’s) tank casualty is attributed to only the German’s (or Soviet’s) tank engagement. For heterogeneous form, the tank casualty is attributed to both tank and artillery engagements. For validating the models, different goodness-of-fit statistics are used for comparison.
